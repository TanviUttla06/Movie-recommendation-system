# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

## Project Overview
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on a dataset of movie reviews. The primary goal is to classify the sentiment of each review into predefined categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. Various machine learning models and natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been utilized to achieve accurate sentiment predictions.

## Key Features
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
   - Preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
   - Text vectorization methods including Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec.

2. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Random Forest
   - Decision Tree
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Logistic Regression
   - Naive Bayes
   - XGBoost

3. **Dataset:**
   - The dataset contains movie reviews and corresponding sentiment labels.
   - The `Phrase` column is used for textual data, and the `Sentiment` column is the target variable with labels ranging from 0 to 4.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score

## Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.8 or above)
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - XGBoost

## How to Run
1. Preprocess the dataset using the provided preprocessing script.
2. Train the models by running the training script.
3. Evaluate the performance of each model on the test dataset.

## Results
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost, which outperformed simpler models in terms of accuracy and robustness.

## Future Work
- Integration of deep learning models like LSTMs and BERT for enhanced performance.
- Exploring domain-specific word embeddings for improved sentiment classification.
